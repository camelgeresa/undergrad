Welcome! This 3rd year undergraduate project analyses data from a spectral flow cytometry experiment where we took samples from mice at repeated time intervals from 0h to 72h and looked at the changes in expression of 30 different markers and the differential abundance of different cell types between control, naproxen and hydrogen sulfide linked naproxen.
